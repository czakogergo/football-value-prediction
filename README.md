# Player Transfer Fee Prediction ðŸŽ¯

This project was developed as part of a university program, with the goal of **predicting football player transfer fees** using machine learning techniques.

The repository contains the projectâ€™s **report and presentation**:
- `docs/report.pdf` â€“ detailed technical report  
- `docs/slides.pdf` â€“ presentation slides  

During the project, several regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) were applied to estimate player market values, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and error analysis (MAE, MAPE).

The raw datasets and executable notebooks are not publicly available at this time, but the documents above demonstrate the applied methodology and the achieved results.
